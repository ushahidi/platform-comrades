## What is Ushahidi?

Ushahidi is an open source web application for information collection, visualization and interactive mapping. It helps you to collect info from: SMS, Twitter, RSS feeds, Email. It helps you to process that information, categorize it, geo-locate it and publish it on a map.

### I'm a developer, should I contribute to Ushahidi v3?

Yes! Development moves pretty quickly but the tech stack is getting more and more stable. If you're keen to help build something awesome, [jump on board..][getin]

## References
This is one of three repositories related to COMRADES deployment of Ushahidi, [which is being tested here](https://comrades-stg.ushahidi.com/views/map).
* This repo contains the primary source code for the functionality of the platform. The “development” branch is our sandbox and the “master” branch is production.
* The [platform-client-comrades repo](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform-client-comrades) contains code for the deployment’s graphical user interface. The “development” branch is our sandbox and the “master” branch is production.
* The test deployment also connects to other web services. In the [comrades-service-proxy repo](https://github.com/ushahidi/comrades-service-proxy) you will find code for an intermediary proxy which uses [YODIE from the University of Sheffield](https://gate.ac.uk/applications/yodie.html) to annotate posts in the COMRADES test Platform.
* The project website for this [COMRADES H2020 European Project](http://www.comrades-project.eu) can be found here. It contains a variety of outputs from the project such as [specific documentation within reports](http://www.comrades-project.eu/outputs/deliverables.html), access to our training [data and ontologies](http://www.comrades-project.eu/outputs/datasets-and-ontologies.html), and [academic research](http://www.comrades-project.eu/outputs/papers.html).
